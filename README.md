# Automating-Data-Annotation-under-Strategic-Human-Agents

This is the code for our NeurIPS 2024 paper ```Automating Data Annotation under Strategic Human Agents: Risks and Potential Solutions```

The experiments have been done on 5 datasets by directly running the following notebooks:

- ```Uniform_Exp.ipynb```: This notebook produces all results for the ```Uniform-linear dataset```
- ```Gaussian_Exp.ipynb```: This notebook produces all results for the ```Gaussian dataset```.
- ```German_Exp_10d.ipynb```: This notebook produces all results for the ```German Credit dataset```.
- ```Credit_Exp.ipynb```: This notebook produces all results for the ```Credit Approval dataset```.
- ```Income_Exp.ipynb```: This notebook produces the complementary results of ```ACSIncome-CA dataset``` while using a neural network to produce feature embeddings.
- ```Different_Q.ipynb```: This notebook produces experimental results under different cost matrices.
